## Donavan Slack designed these projects over the course of 2023 
as a collection of public projects. As he currently utilizes languages such as
Python, C++, and Java to create his portfolio, he hopes to inspire any 
new or developing programmers to continue to never stop improving their skills 
and ALWAYS be willing to learn.
